https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single 
day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

CLUE: keep checking the MIN AND MAX at each stage.

Solution:
[7 1 5 3 6 4]

currmin=1000000
currmax=-10000000

i = 0, price = 7
currMin = min(∞, 7) = 7
profit = 7 - 7 = 0
currMax = max(-∞, 0) = 0

i = 1, price = 1
currMin = min(7, 1) = 1
profit = 1 - 1 = 0
currMax = max(0, 0) = 0

i = 2, price = 5
currMin = min(1, 5) = 1
profit = 5 - 1 = 4
currMax = max(0, 4) = 4

i = 3, price = 3
currMin = min(1, 3) = 1
profit = 3 - 1 = 2
currMax = max(4, 2) = 4

i = 4, price = 6
currMin = min(1, 6) = 1
profit = 6 - 1 = 5
currMax = max(4, 5) = 5

i = 5, price = 4
currMin = min(1, 4) = 1
profit = 4 - 1 = 3
currMax = max(5, 3) = 5

Final Answer
max profit = 5


Buy at 1, sell at 6.


Solution:
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int currMin=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int currMax=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length;i++){
            if(prices[i]<currMin){
                currMin=prices[i];
            }
            if(prices[i]-currMin> currMax){
                currMax=prices[i]-currMin;
            }
        }
        return currMax;
    }
}
